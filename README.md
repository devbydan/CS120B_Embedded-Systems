# CS120B_Embedded-Systems

## Basic Information:
Embedded systems include almost any computing system other than traditional computers. Examples include cell phones, set-top boxes, medical devices, alarm systems, automotive systems, portable music players, etc. Embedded systems is one of the fastest growing areas in computing, having high impact on people's lives, and with tremendous potential for innovative new products. If you think about it, many of the most exciting computing systems today are embedded systems -- iPods and iPhones, Mars rovers, Wii video game consoles, GPS-based people trackers, and more. The embedded systems landscape is one of tremendous innovation and impact -- new inventions, many from students like yourselves, come about every day.

## Online Content:
All students are required to register and participate in the course via iLearn (http://ilearn.ucr.edu). All relevant course announcements, updates, assignments, etc., will be distributed via iLearn.

This course will use an online interactive textbook, “Programming Embedded Systems,” offered by Zyante Learning (http://www.zyante.com/). Students are required to subscribe, register, and use Zyante’s interface. More details are provided in the syllabus under “Required Items.” 

## Required Items:
Online Interactive Textbook: “Programming Embedded Systems” (PES) by Zyante Learning. CS 120B covers Ch. 1-7.

It is worth noting that Zyante Learning is a UCR startup company, co-founded by Prof. Frank Vahid (who built and regularly teaches CS 120B). If you are interested in the underlying philosophy of Zyante’s approach, or if you want to learn more about future updates, the company’s mission, etc., you can visit blog.zybooks.com.

When performing interactive exercises in PES, you are encouraged to provide feedback via the ‘Feedback’ button at the lower-right hand side of each activity.

Please send any questions to support@zybooks.com

Laboratory kit, available from the UCR IEEE (http://ieee.ee.ucr.edu/). A parts list will be provided, upon individual request, if you want to order parts on your own.

Additional online material and articles may be assigned for reading; it will be distributed via iLearn (e.g., weblinks, documents attached to announcements, etc.)


## Optional Reading:

Programming in C (ProgC), Ch. 8-18 of the online ZyBook.

General Course Features and Policies:

> Study groups: Engineering is a social discipline, requiring good people skills. Furthermore, working with others enhances learning. Therefore, we STRONGLY encourage studying together. Students in a study group should solve each problem individually. Specifically disallowed is solving a problem as a group, dividing up problems among the group, and other non-individual approaches. Instead, a study group serves to allow for explanation of what the problem is asking and of generally how to solve the problem, to enable quick assistance when one gets stuck individually solving a problem, and to check each others' solutions. Each student's solution should look distinct—there are typically countless variations of solutions to a problem.

> Helping others: Helping others enhances one's own learning, and also, well, helps others (remember, you can all get As). Thus, we encourage you to help others in the lab if you have the time. You should not write code for others nor show your code to other lab groups. But helping find bugs, teaching how to debug, and helping to explain concepts, are perfectly acceptable.

> Detected cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued aggressively, to protect other students. Grade sanctions and formal university incident reporting will be carried out. Copying code or deriving code for the labs from any source (current students, past students, textbooks, web, etc.) is not allowed unless explicitly authorized. Copying or deriving answers from past homework, quiz, or other solutions is not allowed. Lab partners must all contribute significantly to each lab being turned in jointly; if a partner did not contribute significantly, his/her name should not be included on the lab submission. If you suspect cheating, let the instructors know (anonymous email or notes are welcome).

> Success in computer science and electrical engineering courses requires time. A typical student needs to spend about 15 hours per week on this course (including lecture and lab).
